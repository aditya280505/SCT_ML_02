# 🧠 Customer Segmentation using KMeans Clustering

This project applies the KMeans clustering algorithm to segment mall customers based on their **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**. Customer segmentation helps businesses understand and target different customer types more effectively.

## 📊 Problem Statement

Segment customers based on:
- **Annual Income (k$)**
- **Spending Score (1–100)**

This helps understand:
- Who spends the most
- Which groups might need promotions
- Where the business can target next

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Load the dataset** (`Mall_Customers.csv`)
2. **Select features** for clustering: `Annual Income` and `Spending Score`
3. Use the **Elbow Method** to find optimal clusters (K)
4. Train a **KMeans model**
5. **Visualize** the clustered customer segments

---

## 📌 Results

- 5 distinct customer clusters were identified.
- Visualization clearly shows different spending and income patterns.
- Centroids are marked to show cluster centers.
